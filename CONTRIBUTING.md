# Pull Request Order

Each pull request should contain only one change. This means that pull requests like "fix: many fixes" are not accepted; it's preferable to submit separate pull requests, each with specific, even small, changes.

# Commit

Commits must adhere to the conventions of conventional commits and commit lint.

# First, an issue!

Before making a pr for a fix or feature make an issue to let the team know, the reasons and getting the community's opinion!
